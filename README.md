Diagnose Diabetes 
Overview
This project develops a Python-based AI model to predict diabetes using a Random Forest Classifier. The model analyzes medical data (e.g., Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure) and provides predictions with confidence levels. It includes an interactive interface and visualizations to make the results easy to understand.

Features
Loads and processes a CSV dataset with health features.
Trains a Random Forest Classifier to predict diabetes outcomes.
Offers an interactive input system using ipywidgets for user data entry.
Generates visualizations (correlation heatmaps and feature importance plots) with seaborn and matplotlib.
Displays prediction results with confidence scores.
